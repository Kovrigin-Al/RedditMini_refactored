# RedditMini

## _Single page application_

This social media app is a clone of [Reddit] with limited functionality, i.e. designed for content consumption (90% of users consume content and do not create).

## Features:

    This app allows users:
    - Read posts and watch videos in the feed with **infinite scrolling**;
    - Search for subreddits and content via **debounced search** bar;
    - Read comments on each post using the **nested comment system**;
    - Be notified by **custom toasts** about some events;
    - Seamlessly navigate through content on any device thanks to **data caching** and **responsive design**.

    The app is based on the open Reddit API and does not require authentication.

## Technologies:

- [React] - a JavaScript library for building user interfaces;
- [TypeScript] - typed programming language that builds on JavaScript;
- [Redux Toolkit] - powerful and scalable state management;
- [RTK Query] - data fetching and caching tool;
- [Tailwind] - a utility-first CSS framework.
